# d3.chart

A framework for creating reusable charts with [D3.js](http://d3js.org).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/misoproject/d3.chart.png)](https://travis-ci.org/misoproject/d3.chart)

To get started you can:

* Read about reusability in d3 [here](http://weblog.bocoup.com/reusability-with-d3/)
* Read our introduction post to d3.chart [here](http://weblog.bocoup.com/introducing-d3-chart/)
* Dive right into the [wiki](http://github.com/misoproject/d3.chart/wiki), which is full of instructions and guides.
* Check out the [Miso Project website](http://misoproject.com/d3-chart) which has some live coding examples

## Installing

You can install d3.chart via [bower](http://bower.io) by running:

    $ bower install d3.chart

Otherwise, you can download it directly and embed it using a script tag.

`d3.chart` depends on D3.js, so include it only *after* D3.js has been
defined in the document, e.g.

```html
<script src="scripts/lib/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/lib/d3.chart.min.js"></script>
```
